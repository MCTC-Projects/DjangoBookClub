A Python and Django powered webapp that interfaces with the Java BookClub app


Functionality that is available:

    
    use WebInterface class in BookClub Java app and method getBooks with the bookclub 
    owner "internetrandom" and "password" for password.
    Also try the method postBooks with the same bookclub owner and an ArrayList of 
    books with title, author, and isbn. If all three aren't specified the server will 500.
    
    
    Checkout the site at mctc-bookclub.herokuapp.com. The main page is a login for a normal bookclub user. 
    One such normal bookclub user is "somebodyelse" with "password" as the password. 
    Checkout /registration/ page where a new bookclub can be made
    
    
    
Something that is fun is using the WebInterface class and postBooks to post books to the MCTC-Bookclub with 
owner "internetrandom" and password "password". When "somebodyelse" logs in with "password" for the password
he/she will find a new book posted to the page.
